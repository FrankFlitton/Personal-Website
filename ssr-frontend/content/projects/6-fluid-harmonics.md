longDescription: "Fluid Harmonics is a triple play instrument featuring a sound bank of 30 guitars.
\n\n
The digital synth's three arpeggiators move in sync to create a fluid sound. This is graphically supported by the pick shaped knobs that visually fill with rolling water based on intensity."

## Sound Designer

### Layers
The performances in the Fluid Harmonics sound engine are created by three guitar samples layered on top of each other. The tabs along the top of the interface provide key information and navigation between the sound layers. The user can see and adjust the output volume and left-right panning as well as change the base sound samples.

### Synthesis
The base sound can then be colored by additional filters and oscillators that fine tune the performance per note. Many of these settings can further humanize the performance in addition to adding color. Settings like randomness and phase help performances sound less robotic from note to note.

Finally, chains of up to six effects can by applied both per layer and to the master output.

## Triple Play Sequencer

Each of the three layers have a series of sequencers that run independently. By modifying the pitch, intensity, left right panning, and volume independently fluid cascading motion and evolving patterns are created that drive the performance. Each sequence can have a different length.

The sequence can be either modified by dragging the bars or using the controls to make quick edits across the whole pattern. Other aspects of playback like adding swing or if the notes alternate through multiple input notes (ie. picking strings of a held chord on a guitar) can be set on this screen.

## Layer Color Variations

All layers have the same controls and are visually differentiated by color through the application.
