Bringing design and technology to great a great experience is at the heart of everything I build. Considering customer use cases to drive a database structure or an interface design is as important as designing an API around a great developer experience.

I grew up in the music industry, and cut my teeth programming music plugins, marketing web pages, and designing album artwork packaging. As technologies changed, there was a constant: a great user experience.I believe that a truly great piece of software should be like a great guitar: it feels great to use, looks amazing, and the musician can create amazing music for others to enjoy.

Realizing that a good experience is at the heart of great software, I attended design school to learn communicating by the design of scalable communication systems while teaching myself how to program. From coding interactive embedded web apps, I have gone on to lead software engineering teams using the latest fullstack and serverless architectures â€” frontend through to backbend, database, and containerized cloud infrastructure.

To push the impact one person can make I am currently leading teams building generation experiences: cross platform iOS, Android, and web apps, embedding AI models into their web APIs, as well as creating custom design ops tooling.
