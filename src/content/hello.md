I believe a great piece of software is like a great guitar: it feels great to use, looks amazing, and the musician can create amazing music for everyone to enjoy.

I grew up in the music industry and cut my teeth programming music plugins, websites, and designing album packages. Realizing that UX was at the heart of great software, I attended design school to learn how to create scalable communication systems while teaching myself to code.

Throughout my career I’ve built CMS sites for local and national businesses, instructional courses for the University of Waterloo, and digital campaigns for ad agencies. These experiences helped me understand how businesses work and how technology solves their problems.

I have lead software engineering teams at startups and enterprise companies, building full-stack products with front-end and back-end, database, and containerized cloud infrastructure. I’ve also gained experience prototyping solutions for cross platform iOS and Android apps, and embedding AI models into web APIs.

Currently I'm a UX Engineer at Google responsible for front end development and UX design. In my spare time, I create audio production software and custom design ops tooling (Sketch plugins and Python tooling) to help me manage large UI/UX projects.
