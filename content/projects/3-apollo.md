## Initial Screen

The initial screen resembles a guitar amp. It uses familiar imagery of the hard leather exterior and metal finishes to ground the user in a familiar place while the orange and blue lighting effects give a hint of the ethereal sound scapes to come.

From here, the user is encouraged to explore presets and adjust the sound of the guitar with the amp controls above and the effect pallet below.

## Pads Screen

This is where Apollo takes you on a journey through a black hole and back. Each sound can generate 2 synth pads. Moaning swells, fast pulses, and sustained frequency are brought into the composer's hands. They glow with intensity as the levels increase.

## Mixer Screen

This screen is meant to act as a sort of mission control for the mix. The Apollo sound engine can have up to 12 channels of sounds active at once. With all of those layers piling up, modifying the pan, and volume levels are essential to polishing the final performance.

Reversing the sound be accessed on this panel in addition to the effect palette to bring the performance to new depths and produce other worldly sounds.

## Ambient Designer

This is a revolutionary new approach to guitar-based ambient sound design. Each color group represents a group of keys on the keyboard, too high or low to produce a sound, that can trigger which ambient noise is played with the rest of the guitar performance. The dramatic crescendos and reflective emptiness gain a new level of intimacy with the ability to design an environment, not just a guitar riff.

The mastering and compression tools alow the subtle peaks of the designed ambient environment to delight the senses and stand firmly with the rest of the mix.
