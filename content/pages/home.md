I believe exceptional software is like a finely crafted instrument—intuitive, visually appealing, and capable of empowering users to achieve great results. My tech journey began in the music industry, where I developed music plugins, built websites, and designed album artwork. Realizing the importance of User Experience (UX) in creating impactful software, I focused on mastering scalable HCI UI/UX systems while deepening my software engineering expertise.

Over the course of my career, I’ve led engineering teams in both startups and large enterprises, building everything from full-stack web applications to AI-driven systems and cloud infrastructure. My work spans industries and technologies, including AI/ML tools, scalable web platforms, and data-driven solutions for global users.

I’ve had the privilege of working at Google, TD Bank, and leading AI companies, where I’ve tackled complex challenges in web-centric architectures, big data processing, and full-stack development. Whether building robust APIs, architecting cloud-native solutions, or integrating AI models into scalable products, I’m driven by the opportunity to turn complex problems into elegant, scalable software solutions.

Now, I’m focused on delivering high-impact software that drives innovation, reduces complexity, and scales to meet the needs of global businesses.
