In my view, exceptional software parallels a fine guitar: intuitively usable, aesthetically pleasing, and empowering users to create remarkable outcomes. My journey in technology began in the music industry, where I honed my skills in developing music plugins, creating websites, and designing album artwork. Recognizing the pivotal role of User Experience (UX) in software excellence, I pursued design education to master scalable communication systems, concurrently enhancing my coding expertise.

My career has spanned a range of projects, including the crucible of leading digital campaigns in advertising, creating educational materials for the University of Waterloo, and full stack APIs, React, and iOS applications. My tenure at Google as a UX Engineer and at TD Bank have enriched my understanding of how technology can address business challenges.

I have led software engineering teams in both startups and large enterprises, focusing on delivering comprehensive full-stack products. This includes expertise in front-end, back-end, database management, and cloud-based infrastructures. My skills extend to prototyping cross-platform applications for iOS and Android and integrating AI models into web APIs.

My passion for audio production software and developing custom design operations tools (like Figma plugins, Chrome extensions, and Python scripts) continues to drive my interest in managing large UI/UX projects.
