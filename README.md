# Personal Website

This site is built with React/Next.js centric JAM stack. All content is pre-rendered and served over the Netlify CDN as static HTML.

## Tech Stack
- [React](https://react.dev/): Javascript framework
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/): static HTML generation
- [Github](https://docs.github.com/en/graphql): GraphQL API
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/): hosting, forms, serverless functions
- [Medium](https://medium.com/): Serverless API for blog entries

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run build
```
